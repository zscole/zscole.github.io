## Press Kit

### Bio (Short)
Zak Cole is an Ethereum protocol engineer and founder of the Ethereum Community Foundation. He has three successful Web3 exits (Code4rena, Slingshot, Whiteblock) and authored EIP-6968. A Marine veteran and former Google engineer, he's building infrastructure to take ETH to $10K.

### Bio (Long)
Zak Cole is an Ethereum protocol engineer and serial entrepreneur who has founded multiple successful blockchain companies. As founder and CEO of the Ethereum Community Foundation (ECF), he leads initiatives to strengthen Ethereum's ecosystem and drive ETH to $10,000. Through Number Group, his venture studio, he builds critical infrastructure for the next generation of Web3 applications.

Cole authored EIP-6968 (Contract Secured Revenue), a groundbreaking standard for sustainable protocol funding, and created $BETH, an immutable ERC-20 token representing provably burned ETH. His latest project, Blobkit, is a TypeScript SDK that allows users to leverage Ethereum blob space for arbitrary data storage.

His companies Code4rena, Slingshot Finance, and Whiteblock were all successfully acquired after achieving significant milestones—Code4rena secured over $100M in bug bounties, Slingshot became a leading DEX aggregator, and Whiteblock's research proved fundamental flaws in competing blockchains.

A former Google software engineer and Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq (2007-2008), Cole combines deep technical expertise with operational excellence. He is also co-founder of 0xbow and Privacy Pools, focusing on privacy-preserving DeFi infrastructure.
