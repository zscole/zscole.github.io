I take all of the below every morning in the form of pills and tinctures.<br> 
I try to drink 1 gallon of water a day and run 3-5 miles.<br> 
I do not drink anything other than water or tea.<br>
I eat 90% plant based and 10% meat.<br>
The meat I eat is mostly fish. I eat chicken and beef occasionally when eating out at nice restaurants. <br>
I do not consume excess sugar, caffeine, or alcohol. I try to avoid breads. Cheese is ok. <br>
This doesn't work for everyone, but it works for me. <br>
Please consult your doctor before trying any of this. I am not a medical professional, just a guy trying to find what protocols work best for navigating this world.<br>    
I sleep for at least 8 hours a night. If I don't, it has a terrible effect on my mood.<br>
